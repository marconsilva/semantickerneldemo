## Demos üé•

### 1. Light Plugin Demo üí°

**Description:**
This demo showcases how to create and use lightweight plugins with the Semantic Kernel. It provides a simple example to get started with plugin development.

**Setup:**
- Navigate to `src/Demo001_LightPluginDemo/`.
- Open the solution file `semantickerneldemo.sln` in Visual Studio.
- Build and run the project.

---

### 2. Built-In Plugins üîå

**Description:**
Explore the built-in plugins available in the Semantic Kernel, including integrations with Bing Search, Google Text Search, and more.

**Setup:**
- Navigate to `src/Demo002_BuiltIn/`.
- Open the solution file `semantickerneldemo.sln` in Visual Studio.
- Build and run the desired plugin project (e.g., `GoogleTextSearch`).

---

### 3. Agentic RAG üìñ

**Description:**
This demo demonstrates how to use the Semantic Kernel for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with agents. It includes a recipe guide example.

**Setup:**
- Navigate to `src/Demo003_AgenticRAG/RecipeGuide/`.
- Open the solution file `semantickerneldemo.sln` in Visual Studio.
- Build and run the `RecipeGuide` project.

---

### 4. MCP (Model Context Protocol) üåê

**Description:**
Learn how to set up and use the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server and client for advanced integrations.

**Setup:**
- Navigate to `src/Demo004_MCP/`.
- Install Node.js (if not already installed):
  ```
  Download and install Node.js from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).
  ```
- Open a terminal and navigate to `src/Demo004_MCP/MCPServer/`.
- Run the following commands:
  ```
  npm install
  npm start
  ```
- Alternatively, you can use the MCP Inspector to run the server:
  ```
  npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector dotnet run
  ```
  This will start the MCP Inspector, displaying a URL in the terminal (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:6274`). Open this URL in a browser to access the MCP Inspector interface.
- Open the solution file `semantickerneldemo.sln` in Visual Studio.
- Build and run the `MCPClient` project.

---

### 5. Multi-Agent Orchestration ü§ñ

**Description:**
This demo highlights the orchestration of multiple agents using the Semantic Kernel. It includes examples like `AgentsAsPlugins` and `MultiAgentChat`.

**Setup:**
- Navigate to `src/Demo005_Multi-Agent_Orchestration/`.
- Open the solution file `semantickerneldemo.sln` in Visual Studio.
- Build and run the desired project (e.g., `MultiAgentChat`).
